## C4SUE Class Spring 2020 


This repo contains the lab materials for the Computing for Sustainable Urban Environments class at NYU Tandon. 

Throughout the semester more materials will be added. In addition to markdowns (.md fiels), some data will added here. In other cases you will be requested to download the data for an assignment directly from an open data platform. 

At the end of each assignment there would be a mention of the deliveries. Submissions, unless otherwise is detailed, will be done through NYU Classes. ''
